# Credit-card-Fraud-Detection
Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning & Python
# Overview:
The aim of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques for the identification of credit card fraud transactions. By employing various algorithms and tools such as Scikit-Learn and NumPy in Python, this project provides an efficient solution to address the challenge of fraudulent transactions.

# Tools Used:
Scikit-Learn: The project extensively utilizes Scikit-Learn, a robust machine learning library in Python, for building and evaluating machine learning models.
NumPy: NumPy is employed for efficient handling of numerical operations, enhancing the overall performance of the algorithms.
Python Packages: Additional Python packages are incorporated to streamline various aspects of the project.
# Approach:
The project adopts a binary classification approach, treating the problem as a binary decision-making task - whether a transaction is fraudulent or not. Multiple machine learning algorithms are explored to identify the most effective model. By experimenting with different algorithms and fine-tuning parameters, the goal is to discover the algorithm that best fits the dataset and provides accurate predictions.

# Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: The dataset undergoes preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and other data irregularities.
Binary Classification: The problem is formulated as a binary classification task, where transactions are classified as either legitimate or fraudulent.
Algorithm Comparison: Different machine learning algorithms are employed and compared to determine the most suitable model.
Model Evaluation: The performance of each model is rigorously evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
# Future Enhancements:
Continuous improvement of the model through regular updates and fine-tuning.
Integration of advanced techniques such as anomaly detection for enhanced fraud identification.
